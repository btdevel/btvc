_A magic mouth on the wall speaks to you, saying this:

A light beam from the surface is mirrored down here and focused to a burning ray, blocking the corridor. Do you wish to:
Try crossing
You try but are unable to pass through burning ray of light!

A magic mouth on the wall speaks: Know this, that a man called Tarjan, thought to many to be insane, had through wizardly powers
...proclaimed himself a god in Skara Brae a hundred years ago. His image is locked in stone until made whole again...

You have entered the living chambers of Bashar Kavilor, the High Priest.
He screams, "Infidel! Face now the wrath of a servant of the Mad One!"

This is the High Priest's treasure chamber. His pet dragon, Sphynx, peers at you hungrily. "Sphynx eat now," it growls.

Before you lies the ancient burial chamber of King Aildrek, now a creature
of darkness. "Now, mortal man, I will drink of your souls," he hisses.

You are at the Baron's throne. Who wishes to sit on it?

You see the Captain of the Guard standing before you.
"Die, scum!" he screams as he runs insanely toward you.

Before you stand six warriors, dressed in bright green robes. "Intruders!"
 They scream battle cries as they run toward you with drawn swords.

A wizened man appears before you, saying, "Answer this riddle to pass:"
"Once man alive
Now living death
It drinketh blood
N' stealeth breath."
Will you:
Answer riddle
Fight him

A magic mouth on the wall speaks to you, saying this riddle:
Past warscapes fought by men long dead, and treasures lost on bloodied fields, 
the One God lifts his thorn-crowned head, and lays a strength on friendly..

An old statue of a fifteen foot tall warrior stands before you. Will you:
Approach it

An old man stands before you saying, "Answer this question to pass:
What tavern lies off Night Archer street?"

Name the one of cold, foretold twofold:"

Name the endless byway and your path shall be guaranteed:"

A crystal statue comes to life before you, ready to attack! Will you:
Fight it
Something is happening to the golem's shattered body...

Greetings! I am Kylearan, oh perseverent ones, the good wizard of Skara Brae. Put away your weapons, for I am your ally, not an enemy.
You have passed my tests, and can now continue on to your true quest, the source of evil in Skara Brae -- Mangar the Dark, my nemesis.
Mangar's tower, at the opposite corner of Skara Brae, is a five level deathtrap, which can only be entered by use of an onyx key.
Good luck, and remember, seeing is not always believing.
Kylearan vanishes.

Two shapes yours,
  one's around;
 Speak the shape
  and final found"

An old man is here, and says to you:
"I am the Keymaster. I have something to sell you for the low price of 50000 gold pieces."

The man speaks briefly and 6 friends appear. "Most unfriendly," he says. His friends look very angry.

Speak the seven of the One God, in Sequence, and seek the lost stairs:"

There is a large black coffin in this tomb. Do you wish to:
Open it
A Vampire Lord rises from the coffin. He seems rather disturbed.

Your music caused two sleeping dragons to continue slumbering.
Two sleeping dragons awaken at your passage. "Hmm, humans for dinner again,
 Gor," says the small one. "Why don't we get any pork up here?"

Name the greatest son of Odin and win his aid."

On the wall to the north are etched 3 geometric shapes: a square, a circle, and a triangle.

What can bind the mightiest foes?"

This is Mangar's treasure trove. Two dragons are here, and they're very hungry. I think you're in some real trouble.

Death to those who would attack the mighty one!"

You stand in the antechamber of Mangar the Dark, evil Archmage of Skara 
Brae. Mangar glares at you with deep hatred. "Die, mortals!" he screams.
With a wave of his hand a few of his close friends drop by. They don't look like a fun group.

Kylearan, the good Archmage, appears before you in a flash of light. "Well
 done!" he cries, beaming. "Your quest in Skara Brae is now finished!"
"The evil one is now defeated, and his spell of winter will soon end."
"You will all, as a symbol of my gratitude, receive a gold and experience bonus of 300,000 units. Fare well and live long!"
Kylearan vanishes.

` `#`+`An Eye levitates from 
 and goes into the statue's empty socket.
The statue comes to life!

You are being teleported!
Robed Men
The legions of Baron Harkyn stand before you, recognizing you as intruders, "Death to them!" they scream.
